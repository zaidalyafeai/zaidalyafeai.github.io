## Who I am
I am a PhD candidate at [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx) expected to graduate by the end of 2023. My thesis is about encorporating Morphlogy into language understanding for Arabic. I target this task from different aspects including tokenization, text generation, interpertability, and cross lingual understanding. 

## Open Research
In the past few years, I worked on multiple open research collaborative spaces including [arbml](https://arbml.github.io/website/), [bigscience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), and [C4AI](https://cohere.for.ai/).
