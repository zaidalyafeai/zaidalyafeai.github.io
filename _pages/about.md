## Research Interests

My thesis is about encorporating Morphlogy into language understanding for Arabic. I target this task from different aspects including tokenization, text generation, interpertability, and cross lingual understanding. My interest also includes includes working on NLP for low resource languages. I also like to target Arabic NLP from the PoV of culture, hence working on poetry, calligraphy and morphlogy.
