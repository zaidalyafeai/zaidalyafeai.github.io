## Who I am
I am a PhD candidate at [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx) expected to graduate by the end of 2023. I am the co-founder of [arbml](https://arbml.github.io/website/) which is an initiative to support Arabic NLP research and tools. I am also a founding member of [fihmai](https://fihm.ai), which targets publishing resources that enrich AI content in Arabic. I was part of [bigscience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), where I helped in multiple working groups including Tokenization, Data sourcing and Prompting. I am currently a member of [C4AI](https://cohere.for.ai/) an open research environment where we I co-lead the Arabic effort. I mostly hangout in our arbml [discord](https://discord.gg/aN2vaec9nV) if you want to connect to me or drop me a message using <a href="mailto:alyafey22@gmail@@com"

## Research Interests

My thesis is about incorporating Morphology into language understanding for Arabic. I target this task from different aspects including tokenization, text generation, interpretability, and cross lingual understanding. I also like to target Arabic NLP from the PoV of culture, hence working on poetry, calligraphy and morphology. My interest also includes working on NLP for low resource languages.
